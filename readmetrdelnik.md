# <strong> Trdelnik </strong> is a Rust based testing framework for Solana programs written in [Anchor](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/introduction.html) 
</div>

# ðŸ“Œ Core Features


- ### <strong>Trdelnik console </strong>

Trdelnik console will compile and deploy an Anchor program, launch a local cluster 
and give developers a command prompt to interact with the program.

- ### <strong>Trdelnik client</strong>

Trdelnik client wraps Anchor client so there is no need to write code in Javascript.
Developers can build and deploy an Anchor program to a local cluster and run a test suite against it in one Trdelnik command.

- ### <strong>Trdelnik fuzz</strong>
    
Trdelnik fuzz is a tool for automating the testing process. It generates automatically random data as inputs, so developers don't have to write them themselves.

- ### <strong>Trdelnik explorer</strong>

Trdelnik explorer allows developers to simulate Solana transactions against a
local cluster and examine changes of a local ledger.
